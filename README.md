# Road to iOS Development üöÄ

Welcome to my **Road to iOS Development** repository! This is where I'll be documenting my journey of learning iOS development from scratch in just 6 months. This repository will serve as a collection of programs, assets, and projects that I create along the way.

## About Me üëã

Hello, I'm Szymon, and I've set myself an ambitious challenge: I aim to master iOS development in the next six months. I've always been passionate about technology and software development, and with this challenge, I hope to bring my skills to the next level. I'll be updating this repo regularly with all my progress, learnings, and stumbling blocks.

## What to Expect in this Repo üìö

Here you'll find a variety of content including:

- Code snippets and projects: Pieces of code I've written as part of my learning, as well as larger projects as I gain more skills.
- Resources: Links to useful tutorials, articles, and other educational materials I've found helpful on my journey.
- Weekly Reflections: I will be reflecting on my learning journey every week, talking about what I've learned, challenges I faced, and what I plan to learn next.

## Roadmap üó∫Ô∏è

This is a rough guide of how I plan to approach learning iOS development:

1. Month 1: Swift Basics - Variables, Data Types, Control Flow, Functions, Classes and Structs
2. Month 2: More Swift - Protocols, Error Handling, Extensions, Generics, Optionals
3. Month 3: iOS Basics - Storyboards, Interface Builder, MVC architecture
4. Month 4: iOS Intermediate - AutoLayout, Networking, CoreData, User Defaults
5. Month 5: iOS Advanced - Design Patterns, Testing, Debugging, Multithreading
6. Month 6: Final Project - An end-to-end iOS application, applying everything I've learned.
