//To check your knowledge, hereâ€™s a small task for you: create a struct to store
//information about a car, including its model, number of seats, and current gear,
//then add a method to change gears up or down. Have a think about variables and
//access control: what data should be a variable rather than a constant, and what
//data should be exposed publicly? Should the gear-changing method validate its
//input somehow?

struct Car {
    let model: String
    let numberOfSeats: Int
    var currentGear: Int
    
    mutating func changeGear(newGear: Int) {
        if newGear >= 0 {
            currentGear = newGear
        }
    
    }
}
