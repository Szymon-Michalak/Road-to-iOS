//You already know enough to start writing your first useful code, albeit fairly simple: weâ€™re going to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

//Your goal is to write a Swift playground that:
//
//Creates a constant holding any temperature in Celsius.
//Converts it to Fahrenheit by multiplying by 9, dividing by 5, then adding 32.
//Prints the result for the user, showing both the Celsius and Fahrenheit values.

print("The temperature is \(celsius) degrees Celsius, which is \(fahrenheit) degrees Fahrenheit.")
